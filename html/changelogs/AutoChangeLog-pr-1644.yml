changes:
  - balance: Inaprovaline metabolizes slower, so you'll have more time to heal a patient.
  - balance: Brain healing from Inaprovaline separated from healing from Alkysine.
      The former heals 0.5 damage a second, whereas the latter repairs 1.6 damage
      a second.
  - balance: Brain oxyloss damage/second, maximum brain oxyloss damage, and brain
      passive healing is continuous instead of discrete. For details, see graphs attached
      to PR.
